Upgrade firmware levels to current
Set licensing level / input license keys
Enable appropriate features (ip routing, stacking, etc...)
create stacks wherever stacking
For advanced switches only {
    Create a loopback adapter for the switch
    set an IP address /32 or /128 for management
    bind all management features to this loopback
    bind all outgoing communication to this loopback
    // all too often I see "int vlan 10" being used as the 
    // management interface for a switch that is
    // participating in OSPF or BGP. 
    // Management should be on loopback interfaces
    // wherever practical. 
}
Create an ACL of source IP addresses of:
    - Admins: ACL 1

    Option 2: configure VTP {
        Set a VTP domain and/or password
        Create your vlans on the VTP master
        Pray. 
        Backup vlan.dat. 
    }
}
Create port channels or trunks (LAGs) {
    create the port channels or trunks
    assign ports to the port channels or trunks
    assign configurations to the port channels or trunks
    verify that interface configuration for member ports matches the po or trunk config
    verify that LACP or PAGP or whatever is selecting the appropriate number of interfaces
}
Setup VLANs {
    Create/name vlans
    set ports as access/trunk/hybrid ports, configure vlan access explicitly
    // I really hate finding this:
    // int gi 1/1
    //    switchport mode trunk
    //    description "who needs to specify which vlans are allowed, anyway!!!"
    set management vlan if you are moving off of vlan 1
    // you are moving off of vlan 1, right?
    set vlan allowed on port channels or other trunk ports
}
Optional: Create VLAN interfaces {
    If doing L3 configuration:
    create the vlan interfaces, 
    bind interfaces to VRFs, if appropraite
    assign IP addresses, DHCP relays, etc...       
}
Setup DHCP {
    Option 1: {
        Set dhcp filtering to only accept DHCP offers from uplink ports
        Set dhcp relay (if the switch is routing) 
        Set redundant dhcp relay (if there are 2 DHCP server addresses) 
        Set additional dhcp relays (if needed for 802.1x)
    } Option 2: {
        Create DHCP pools
        Create DHCP exclusions
        // seriously, switch manufacturers, why do you not automatically
        // exclude the local interface IP address from DHCP offers? 
    }
}
Setup IPv4 {
    disable DHCP clients on any interfaces that have them by default (vlan 1, for example)
    Create VRFs if appropriate
    bind interfaces to VRFs if appropriate
    Assign IP addresses
    Create VRRP or HSRP sets if appropriate
    Assign *additional* IP addresses if required
    Create appropriate static routes (in VRFs if appropriate)
    Create routing protocol instances, if used
    Configure routing protocol subnets and and peers (per vrf if needed)
}
Setup IPv6 {
    see IPv4, mostly. 
    enable router advertisements if you aren't using DHCPv6, etc...
}
Setup NTP {
    On 3 of your switches, set at least 5 NTP servers (or setup some GPS clocks, etc...)
    On those 3 switches, set eachother as peers
    On those 3 switches, set ACL 3 as permitted to connect to NTP
    On all other switches, set those 3 switches as servers
}

    Select a STP domain name (if appropriate for the protocol you selected)
    Configure STP on the root switch, "root primary"
    Configure STP on the backup root, "root secondary"
    configure the "uplink" ports of each switch as better priority than their access ports
    Client/host ports/BPDU guard, root guard, UDLD, as mentioned
}

    Create a central server that can collect switch configurations and display deltas
    Enter switches into config management
    configure email alerting on configuration changes
}
Setup 802.1x authentication { 
    Configure connectivity to a radius server, set ports to use 802.1x authentication
    create an "auth" vlan for clients who have not yet authenticated
    The auth vlan should be switch-local only and should not propagate past the switch (unless the portal is not on the switch)
    set all ports' default vlan into the "auth" vlan (so if 802.1x fails, the ports are unusable, but not "Down")
}
Setup VTYs and Console {
    Set console passwords, timeouts
    Set vty inputs (SSH? telnet?) 
    // telnet is required for cisco switch clustering ./sigh
    Set vty outputs (none? ssh?)
}
Setup switch clustering (management clustering, not "stacking")
Setup switch clustering (high availability clustering, not "stacking")
Optional: setup port ACLs {
    either use 802.1x to setup some dynamic port ACLs or
    setup some static port ACLs.
}
Optional quality-of-life settings: {
    Disable IP lookup (optional, but nice)
    Set logging asynchronous (optional, but nice)
    If you are on comware, create an alias for "sys" called "enable"
    If you are on comware, create an alias for "display" called "show"
    Turn off nag warnings about transceiver compatibility/support ability
    // service unsupported transceiver
