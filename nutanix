By design NTP on Nutanix does not correct time drifts greater then 5 seconds in any direction. There's a script to ease the cluster node back into the 5 sec window by adjusting to a maximum of 1 minute (on a lab system, about half of it on heavy workloads)
To enable the script, run this command on any CVM:
    allssh '(/usr/bin/crontab -l && echo "*/5 * * * * bash -lc /home/nutanix/serviceability/bin/fix_time_drift") | /usr/bin/crontab -'
We can then periodically check the progress of the script with command:
    allssh "grep Offset data/logs/fix_time_drift.log | tail -n 5"
