By design NTP on Nutanix does not correct time drifts greater then 5 seconds in any direction. There's a script to ease the cluster node back into the 5 sec window by adjusting to a maximum of 1 minute (on a lab system, about half of it on heavy workloads)
To enable the script, run this command on any CVM:
    allssh '(/usr/bin/crontab -l && echo "*/5 * * * * bash -lc /home/nutanix/serviceability/bin/fix_time_drift") | /usr/bin/crontab -'
We can then periodically check the progress of the script with command:
    allssh "grep Offset data/logs/fix_time_drift.log | tail -n 5"

Half-official obscure procedure to change cluster IPs to different subnet (probably to dangerous to do untested on a production cluster)

Before you begin:

1. Make sure that the NTP and DNS are correct, you can check them in Prism.
2. Log on to a Controller VM in the cluster and check that all hosts are part of the metadata store:
nutanix@cvm$ ncli host ls | grep "Metadata store status"
3.Stop the Nutanix cluster:
cluster stop
4. Put the cluster in reconfiguration mode:
cluster reconfig

Changing the CVM address (do not reboot or restart the CVMs until all IP addresses are changed)
1. Log on to ESXi with SSH
2. Connect to the CVM from ESXi:
ssh nutanix@192.168.5.254
3. Run "genesis restart"
4. Open the network interface configuration file and change the IP addresses. You can find the configuration file in the following location: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (you can use vi or nano to make the changes)
5. Update the IP addresses of the Zookeeper hosts
  - First verify the change is possible with the following command: edit-zkmapping check_can_modify_zk_map
  - Change the IP addresses: edit-zkmapping modify_zk_server_config
  - Verify the Zookeeper again: edit-zkmapping check_can_modify_zk_map

  
Before proceeding with the next step change the ESXi IP addresses
- once you are done with the ESXi IP changes, reboot each CVM with the following command: "sudo reboot"

Completing the CVM IP address change:
1. Log on the CVM with SSH
2. Take the CVM out of reconfiguration mode:
rm ~/.node_reconfigure
3. Run "genesis restart"
4. After all the steps start the cluster from any CVM:
cluster start


After finishing all the above steps proceed with the IPMI changes.


If you follow the procedure above I do not expect any issues with the IP change.
