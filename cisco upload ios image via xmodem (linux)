 Upload an IOS Image Via XModem

If you find yourself without an IOS on a switch during a reboot, you will need to transfer an image using Xmodem.

Download the image from TFTP to your computer:

    tftp <tftp server ip>
    get <image name>
    quit

NOTE: You do NOT want to use a .tar package with Xmodem. Only use .bin images. If only a .tar image is available, extract the .bin to your computer.

Download and install Minicom to your computer:

    sudo aptitude install minicom

    Configure Minicom:

    sudo minicom -s

    Filenames and paths
        B (this lets you set the directory to upload from for xmodem)
        Type in the directory path to the IOS image.
    Serial port setup
        Press A
        Type in the path to your serial device (most likely /dev/ttyUSB0)
        Press E
        Press C
    Save setup as dfl
    Exit

Upload the IOS Image

    You should now be at a switch: prompt. If so, make sure there is enough room for the new image in flash:

    dir flash:

    If not,

    format flash:

    Power down, power back up.
    Change the baud rate to 115200:

    set BAUD 115200

    The session should stop responding. No big deal.
        Ctrl-A then Z.
        Press Q
    Console in at 115200 baud.

    minicom -b 115200

    Now, get ready to copy over the new image. (Go grab a cup of coffee, because this is going to take a long time.)

    copy xmodem:<image name> flash:<image name>

    Press Ctrl-A then Z
    Press S
    Select xmodem
    Select the IOS with space
    Press Enter
    The file transfer will start. It will take a long time.
    When it finishes, change the baud back to 9600

    set BAUD 9600

Your session should stop responding. If it does not:

    unset BAUD 115200

    Exit Minicom and reconnect again:
        Ctrl-A then Z
        Press Q

    minicom

    Try to boot from the new image:

    boot flash:<image name>

You should now boot into full IOS.
