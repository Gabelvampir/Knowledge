How to resize a luks partition

After things-not-to-do.mdwn I want to be careful when resizing a luks partition: here's a note with the right procedure.

As explained in this bug report, the way to resize a luks partition is:

# lvresize -L+100M /dev/vg00/test 
  Extending logical volume test to 400.00 MB
  Logical volume test successfully resized
# cryptsetup resize test1 
# resize2fs /dev/mapper/test1
